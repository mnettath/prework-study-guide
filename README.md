# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide webpage is designed to help with the information overload that coding bootcamp students may face during the prework. It highlights key points about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. While creating this study guide webpage, I learned about how these three coding languages work together and impact a webpage. I was also able to familiarize myself with Git, a command line tool that helps with version control. After completing this webpage, I have gained a better understanding of the prework material. I hope this study guide is helpful to other coding bootcamp students.
