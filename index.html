        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements refer to the type of content on a webpage such as text, image, header, or list elements. Elements can also divide content on the page and describe content to browsers and other developers. Meta-related, content division, and semantic elements all help with dividing and describing the content.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information or metadata about the webpage. Elements included here are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element, there are title, style, base, link, meta and script elements.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. The body element is an example of a semantic element. Semantic elements describe the role it plays on the webpage. They are important for collaboration and accessibility.</li>
          <li>Inside of the body element, we can add header, img, br, a, and footer elements. In this case, the parent element would be the body and the children elements would be what is inside of the body.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS style sheets are used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. This is applied to a specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than internal and external sytle sheets.</li>
          <li>With internal CSS style sheets, it is possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file. The head section contains CSS rules for the specific page.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are the most common and allow developers to keep all of their CSS rules in a seperate file which make design changes easier. The CSS file must be linked within the HTML's head element.</li>
          <li>Margin properties indicate how much space we want around the outside of an element. For example, when we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>Padding properties are used to add space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, it actully makes the entire element bigger. It is important to note that margin and padding are not the same.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself or DRY code is a coding principal that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number ofl ines of code that need to be written or maintained. This can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of the codebase.</li>
